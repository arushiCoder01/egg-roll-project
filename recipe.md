***Dough preparation:***
Add 1/2 tsp salt in the flour and mix it, add 2 tbsp of oil and mix it properly.
Add water and knead it into soft and smooth dough, once the dough is ready, cover it and leave it for 15 minutes.
Divide the dough into equal portions, take one dough ball and roll it into chapati/roti shape.
Repeat the process to roll the other dough ball.
***Egg roll preparation:***
Crack the eggs in a bowl(I am using 2 eggs for one roll), add 1/4 tsp salt, whisk it properly.
Heat little oil in a pan, put the rolled maida roti/chapati in the frying pan.
Cook it for a minute on low flame, flip it to cook other side.
Cook it properly from both the sides, once it is cooked properly, take it out in a plate.
Add oil in the same pan and let it heat, add egg in the pan, cook it for few seconds on low-medium flame.
Place the cooked roti/chapati on the top of egg, let it cook for 10-12 seconds.
Flip it and cook it for another 6-8 seconds, take it out in a plate and repeat the process to cook the other egg coated roti/chapati.
Take one egg coated chapati/roti, add chopped cucumber, onion and green chilli at the middle of the roll.
Sprinkle little salt, chat masala, lemon juice as per your taste, tomato ketchup and little chilli sauce.
Gently roll it and wrap bottom of the roll with butter paper or foil paper.
Egg roll is ready to serve.
